Welcome to Rocket Castle: a platform for people to create and play interactive, single-player, text-based games and stories.

Rocket Castle is currently just a couple hundred line JavaScript class and some CSS. Nothing at all is formalized and everything has and will change.

The primary goal of the project is to teach my kids programming using JavaScript.

# TODO

- [ ] Create base themes like `dungeon`, `forest`, `space`, etc.
- [ ] Handle dark/light modes as a base set of CSS games can pick from. [This article](https://css-tricks.com/dark-modes-with-css/) talks about some important styling points on dark sites.  But, I don't think auto-dark-mode is useful for RC.
- [ ] Make the `tell` method produce a custom modal rather than calling `alert()`.
- [ ] Add an `ask` method which gives the ability to ask the player questions in a modal.
- [x] Integrate [Foundation](https://get.foundation/).
- [ ] Add more ways to display a room than just title, details, and options.
- [ ] Formalize a way to create mixins to add, for example, game mechanics or new UI elements.
- [ ] Create a guide that can take a kid from zero to a game.
